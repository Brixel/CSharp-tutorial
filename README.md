# CSharp-tutorial
This git repository works as a code-storage for the C# tutorial that [Berend Wouters](https://github.com/berendwouters) will give at Brixel.
The tutorial will focus on various things, including the usage of Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, basic coding standards, basic function writing. Also a touch of object-oriented programming will be included.
The C#-syntax we'll be using is C# 6, however this will not be the main focus.
